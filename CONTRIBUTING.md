# Contribution

In order to contribute to this project, contributors are required to follow a specific workflow to ensure that due process is followed and changes made are documented and reviewed properly.

## Steps

1. If your change is specific (bug fix, minor change, small enhancement, etc.), create a branch with an appropriate name.
2. Immediately create a PR for that branch, documenting the changes in as much detail as possible. Link to issues if required.
3. Start commiting to the branch. Once you've completed the changes, request for review.
4. If there are changes to be made post-review, add them in through commits.
5. Once the required number of reviewers have approved, the changes will be merged by the reviewer.

## Note

* Only create issues for changes if it is planned to be done later, or is about a bug.
* If you plan to make bigger changes (new feature, big bug fix) (we'll call them goals), create an initial branch for the goal and then create sub-branches for each specific change required to achieve that goal.
* Make sure each specific change branch still follows the standard workflow described above. Make reviews mandatory for the goal branch and any branch that will receive merged changes. At least one reviewer needs to approve.
